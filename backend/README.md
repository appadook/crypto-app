# Backend Setup for Crypto App

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-app.git
    cd crypto-app/backend
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python run.py
    ```

Your backend server should now be running, and you can start developing your crypto app.
